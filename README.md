# socket-io-notification-working

This followed the tutorial on 

[Real time notification app using Socket.io: https://codeforgeek.com/2015/09/real-time-notification-system-using-socket-io/](https://codeforgeek.com/2015/09/real-time-notification-system-using-socket-io/)


Slight modifications to get working code from the tutorial will be in the "socketDemo" branch. Grunt is not being utilized so to run the app, run in root directory using:

`npm start`

**NOTE: I used a non-root account for mySQL login in `Server/index.js` and `bin/index.js` since root login wasn't working for me, so please change this to a login of your choosing.** 

Other branches, including master, is for my personal development experience and to use the initial socket.io app to extend or implement certain functionality of my choosing.
